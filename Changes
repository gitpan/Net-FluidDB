        * Fixes a few tests that weren't correct for Perl with long doubles
          (that is, the test themselves had a bug). Thanks to CPAN Testers
          for discovering this.

0.07    2009-10-09
        * No longer a beta.
        * Full support for tagging.

0.06    2009-09-25
        * Sends flags to FluidDB as proper booleans, thus playing nice with
          the revision deployed today.
        * More tests.

0.05    2009-09-21
        * Speaks the API released today in the sandbox
        * Implements tagging objects with undef
        * Documents a couple of tips related to tagging with numbers and strings
        * All JSON::XS stuff has been factored out up to Base.pm
        * The new Moose role Net::FluidDB::HasPath provides stuff related to
          names and paths which is common to tags and namespaces
        * Object creation without about tag sends no payload
        * When a request fails now we print response headers to STDERR, with
          the upgrade error data comes there
        * When an object is tagged, the corresponding path is added to its tag_paths
          unless present. (Reported by JJ Merelo.)

        * Namespace attributes "parent", "name", and "path" are now read-only
        * Tag attributes "indexed", "namespace", "name", and "path" are now read-only
