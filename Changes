Revision history for Net-FluidDB

0.05    2009-09-21
        * Speaks the API released today in the sandbox
        * Implements tagging objects with undef
        * Documents a couple of tips related to tagging with numbers and strings
        * All JSON::XS stuff has been factored out up to Base.pm
        * The new Moose role Net::FluidDB::HasPath provides stuff related to
          names and paths which is common to tags and namespaces
        * Object creation without about tag sends no payload
        * When a request fails now we print response headers to STDERR, with
          the upgrade error data comes there
        * When an object is tagged, the corresponding path is added to its tag_paths
          unless present. (Reported by JJ Merelo.)
